py-affective
============

PyAffective is a stand alone affective module for intelligent agents.
It is general purpose enough so it can be used independently of your agent framework, yet specialized enough so it can provide a comprehensive model for managing an internal affective state.

Based on the paper [ALMA - A Layered Model of Affect](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1082478) by Patrick Gebhard
